## Intro

In this docs site you’ll find background information on the Bitcoin Wildlife Conservatorium project, its current focus areas, and how you can contribute.

Bitcoin Wildlife is a community project focused on developing, testing and iterating on primitives in Bitcoin Script with the introduction of OP_CAT. All implementations are tested on Catnet, a fork of Signet with OP_CAT activated that features a Circle STARK Verifier directly in Script.

Developers and researchers who are interested in showcasing why OP_CAT should, or shouldn’t, be activated on Bitcoin are invited to contribute to this project.

Developers and researchers are also invited to apply for a grant from the [insert fund name] for their work on OP_CAT R&D.
