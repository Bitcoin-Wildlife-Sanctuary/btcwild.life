## Outcomes

The desired outcome of this initiative is to consolidate the knowledge and tools necessary to evaluate and implement experimental Bitcoin features. By rigorously testing and documenting these advancements, we seek to provide the Bitcoin development community with a clearer understanding of the potential risks and benefits associated with these experimental features.

Ultimately, this body of work aims to inform the broader discussion on Bitcoin's evolution, offering a repository of tested ideas and implementations that can be referenced for future upgrades or soft forks. In doing so, we hope to ensure that any enhancements to Bitcoin are made with a comprehensive understanding of their implications, paving the way for more secure, scalable, and innovative applications on the network.
